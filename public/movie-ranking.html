<h1>The Best Animes According to Varun</h1>
<h2>My top 3 animes of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Attack On Titan</h3>
<p>The best written show and the best piece of fiction, and is my no 1.</p>
<h3>Jobless Reincarnation</h3>
<p>The best isekai story ever written and is so satisfying.<br/>
  The fantasy element is so beautiful.
</p>
<h3>Classroom of The Elite</h3>
<p>One of the best psychological mind games show.<br/>
  Although the sourcew material the "light novel" is mindblowing the anime isn't half bad but is not as good as the source.
